GEEKY App




GEEKY App is an application developed in SwiftUI that serves as a miniature to-go app for geeks. Originally planned as one project, I had to divide it into two mini apps.

Community Target: Geeks! :)

Geeky News: An application that uses the YCombinator Hacker News API at its core to showcase the latest news and articles on tech, science, and geeky topics. The articles themselves are proposed by the community members (geeks) and are furthermore either upvoted or downvoted by the other members. Such structure is therefore an average representation of the main interesting stories that the named community finds the most interesting at a given time. In the application, the articles are displayed in voting order and the number of people who liked each article is displayed on the left. 

Use to the community: Such a news network is entirely run by the members of the community and therefore is useful to any geek. Geeky News is an optimal to-go YCombinator Hacker News application for iPhone when you are stuck in traffic and have time to read something interesting to yourself (especially if you consider yourself part of the geeky group). Such an application is focused on, run by, and made for the geeky/science people in order to read news and articles that people with the same mindset consider interesting or worthy of your time compared to any other average news app. 

Geeky Track: An application that any geeky person should use in order to keep track of their favorite films, video games, books and etc. You can add as many categories as you want and add as many items within your category. If you saw an interesting Sci-fi movie poster you haven’t seen, you can easily add it to the Film category, and when you finally watched it you can either tick or delete the item from the category. 

Use to the community: As both of those mini-apps should be considered as one, it is a good tool to have when you read something interesting displayed on Geeky News. You can immediately add something that you found out to the Geeky Track app in order to “track” it down later. Alternatively, the app can also be used as a standalone geek companion, listing and following, and keeping track of your favorite movies, TV shows, and books.



If any problems occur, I would suggest trying the latest iOS or 7th gen iPod touch.
